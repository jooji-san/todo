Completed:
* code for cancel button on the add-div
* display view all as default on the startup
* display the time till the todo is due, instead of the full date { if difference in days is smaller than 2 }
* text input should take up the whole line in add-div
* add new project button
* set today's date as the default value for the input
* add description section in expanded view
* add hour input
* sort by properties
* view todos for today
* dim on hover
* add ability to change properties in expanded view
* save projects.obj [now on the change of the properties in expanded div]
* move completed tasks to bottom (IMO first sort them by property and sort the completed tasks to the bottom)
* hide completed tasks - checkbox on the top

Do:
* remember scroll position when opening extended and return to that point after closing instead
* mobile version with the button on the top to open the sidebar in the full view
*- set margin on the checkbox so that the bordering area isn't gonna open expand view (actually you should wrap the checkbox in another div)
